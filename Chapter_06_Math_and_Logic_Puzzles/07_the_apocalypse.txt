6.7 The Apocalypse: In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately 
concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all families should ensure 
that they have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families abide by this 
policy — that is, they have continue to have children until they have one girl, at which 
point they immediately stop — what will the gender ratio of the new generation be? (Assume 
that the odds of someone having a boy or a girl on any given pregnancy is equal). Solve 
this out logically and then write a computer simulation of it.

---
We can model having a girl using the geometric distribution: it gives the probability that 
the first occurrence of success requires k independent trials, each with success probability p.
Success in this case mean having a girl. p = 0.5

We know that the mean of the geometric distribution is 1 / p. In this case it's equal 1/p = 1/0.5 = 2 
which means that on average families will have 2 children: the second one is a girl thus the first 
one must be a boy. The gender ratio of the new generation will be 1:1.
