6.9 100 Lockers: There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening 
all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he 
toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed). 
This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every 
i-th locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100, 
how many lockers are open?

---
- A locker will be open after the 100th pass if it was toggled odd number of times
- Locker #N will be toggled on the i-th pass if "i" divides "N"
- The number of open lockers will be equal to the number of numbers between 1 and 100 
which have odd number of divisors
- Most numbers have even number of divisors because if a divides N than there is another 
number b such that N = a * b. 
For example, 
12 = 2 * 6 = 3 * 4
20 = 2 * 10 = 4 * 5
- There number that have odd number of divisors though: 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3 * 3, etc.
- 9 lockers will end up being open: 1st, 4th, 9th, 16th, 25th, 36th, 49th, 64th, and 81st
