6.8 The Egg Drop Problem: There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from 
the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will 
not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for 
the worst case.

---
- Option 1: drop the first egg from the 1st floor. If it doesn't break, move on to the 2nd floor, 
and so on. It will take 100 drops to find N
- Option 2: drop the first egg from the 50th floor. If it breaks, start dropping the second 
one from from the 1st floor and move up one floor at a time. If the first egg breaks, start 
dropping the second one from the 51st floor. It will take 51 drops to find N
- Option 3: drop the first egg from the 10th floor, then 20th, 30th, and so on. Drop 
the second one from the last floor that didn't break the first egg + 1 and move one 
floor at a time. It will take 19 drops to find N
- Option 4: drop the first egg from the 19th floor and decrease the step by 1: 19, 37, 54, 70, 
85, 99. It will still take 19 drops but there's room for optimization
- Starting from the 16th floor results in 16 drops
- Starting from the 15th floor results in 15 drops
- Starting from the 14th floor results in 14 drops <- optimal strategy
- Starting from the 13th floor results in 22 drops
- Starting from the 12th floor results in 34 drops
