6.5 Jugs of Water: You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water 
(but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs
are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

---
- Fill up 3-quart jug
- Pour all of it to 5-quart one
- Fill up 3-quart jug again
- Pour it to 5-quart one until it fills up. 3-quart jug will contain 1 quart of water
- Empty 5-quart jug
- Pour the content of 3-quart jug (1 quart) to 5-quart one
- Fill up 3-quart jug again and pour it to 5-quart one
- 5-quart one will contains exactly 4 quarts of water
