6.6 Blue-Eyed Island: A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes 
with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. 
There will be a flight out at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, 
but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know 
how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days 
will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

---
- Let's assume there is a single blue-eyed person on the island. This person will see everyone else's 
eye color  and know it's not blue therefore it must be them who are blue-eyed. Thus they will leave.

- If there are 2 blue-eyed people, they would see each other's eye color as well as everyone else's. 
There will not be sufficient information to conclude that anyone should leave on the first day, so 
no one leaves. Each blue-eyed person knows that there is either one or two blue-eyed people. If there 
was just one, they would have left on the first day but they didn't which means there are two. They 
both leave as a result.

- Following the same thought process, in case there are 3 blue-eyed people, no one will leave on first 
two days as each of them wouldn't know if there are 2 or 3 blue-eyed folks. On the third day though they 
will realize that there must be 3 of them as the other 2 would have left on the second day otherwise. 
They will leave as a result.

- It will take N days for the blue-eyed people to leave if there is N of them on the island.
