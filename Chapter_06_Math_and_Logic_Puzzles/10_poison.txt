6.10 Poison: You have 1000 bottles of soda, and exactly one is poisoned. 
You have 10 test strips which can be used to detect poison. A single drop 
of poison will turn the test strip positive permanently. You can put any 
number of drops on a test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as 
many times as you'd like (as long as the results are negative). However, 
you can only run tests once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. 
How would you figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?

- Step 1: 1000 bottles, 10 test strips
Use 10 strips to test 90 bottles each and leave 100 bottles aside. Move to 2a, if 
any strip turns positive, otherwise move to 2b.

- Step 2a: 90 bottles, 9 test strips
Use 9 strips to test 9 bottles each and leave 9 bottles aside. Move to 3a, if 
any strip turns positive, otherwise move to 3b.

- Step 2b: 100 bottles, 10 test strips
Use 10 strips to test 9 bottles each and leave 10 bottles aside. Move to 3a, if 
any strip turns positive, otherwise move to 3b.

- Step 3a: 9 bottles, 8 test strips
Use 8 strips to test 9 bottles each and leave 1 bottle aside. If a strip turns 
positive, corresponding bottle was poisoned. If not, the bottle left aside was poisoned.

- Step 3b: 10 bottles, 10 test strips
Use 10 strips to test 10 bottles. A strip that turns positive indicates which bottle was poisoned.
