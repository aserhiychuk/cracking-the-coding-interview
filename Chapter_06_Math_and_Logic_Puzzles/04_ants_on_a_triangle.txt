6.4 Ants on a Triangie: There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is 
the probability of coliision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides 
of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being 
equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.

Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

---
- Let's say there are 3 ants: A, B, and C
- Each ant chooses to move either to the left or to the right (with equal probability)
- There are 2^3 = 8 possible equally likely scenarios where probability of each of is 1/8:

A B C 
-----
L L L  <- will not collide
L L R 
L R L 
L R R 
R L L 
R L R 
R R L 
R R R  <- will not collide

- The ants will not collidate if and only if they all choose to move to the left or to the right therefore 
the probability of collision can be calculate the following way:

probability of collision = 1 - (1/8 + 1/8) = 3/4
