6.2 Basketball: You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one 
game or the other?

---
- Probability of winning game 1 is p
- Probability of winning gate 2 is 4 * p^3

shot_1 shot_2 shot_3 | prob
---------------------+-----
     0      0      0 | p^3 
     0      0      1 | p^3 
     0      1      0 | p^3 
     0      1      1 | p^3 <- win
     1      0      0 | p^3 
     1      0      1 | p^3 <- win
     1      1      0 | p^3 <- win
     1      1      1 | p^3 <- win

- In order to decide when to pick first game over the second one we need to solve inequality: 
p > 4 * p^3
p^2 < 0.25
p < 0.5

- Pick game 1 if p < 0.5, otherwise pick game 2
