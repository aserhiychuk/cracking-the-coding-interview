6.3 Dominos: There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos
to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

---
- No matter how you position a domino it will always cover one black and one while square
- The 2 corners that have been cut off are of the same color (i.e. either both black or both white) which means the 
board will have either 30 black and 32 white squares or 32 black and 30 white ones
- After putting 30 dominos on the board we will end up with 2 uncovered squares of the same color which means that the remaining piece can not cover both of them
